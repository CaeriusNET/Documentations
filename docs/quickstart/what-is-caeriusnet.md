# What is Caerius.NET ?

Caerius.NET is a `C# 12 .NET 8` library that allows you to map the results of a TSQL Stored Procedure to a C# Data Transfer Object (DTO) in a few microseconds.  
Cause we love C#, ADO.NET and TSQL, we wanted to make it easier for you to use them together.  
We only support C# and SQL Server, and we are proud of it.
