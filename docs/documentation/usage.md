# Usages

This page demonstrates how to leverage Caerius.NET in your projects with various examples.

Given the unique nature of each project, this guide assumes readers are well-versed in best practices and possess solid knowledge of C# and TSQL.

### For C#:
- Proficiency in C# 12 and .NET 8 is required.
- Familiarity with `Best Practices`, `Clean Code`, `SOLID Principles`, `Repository Pattern`, and `Dependency Injection` is recommended.
- Understanding of `sealed class` and `record` types is also recommended.

### For TSQL:
- A strong foundation in TSQL is essential.
- Knowledge of `Stored Procedures` is mandatory.
- Familiarity with `Transactions` is advised.
- For advanced usage, understanding of `Table-Valued Parameters` is beneficial.

## C#: Repository
In your C# application, specific classes should manage database operations. Typically, these reside in a `Repositories` directory, listing each `Repository` class responsible for database interactions, each paired with an `Interface`.

Below is an example of an `Interface` and a `Record`:

::: code-group
```csharp [Interface (Mandatory)]
namespace TestProject.Repositories.Interfaces;

public interface IUserRepository
{
    Task<IEnumerable<UserDto>> GetUserOlderThanAsync(byte age);
    Task UpdateUserAgeByGuidAsync(Guid guid, byte age);
}
```
```csharp [Class]
namespace TestProject.Repositories;

public sealed class UserRepository(ICaeriusDbConnectionFactory Caerius)
    : IUserRepository
{
    public async Task<IEnumerable<UserDto>> GetUserOlderThanAsync(byte age)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public async Task UpdateUserAgeByGuidAsync(Guid guid, byte age)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```
```csharp [Record (Recommended)]
namespace TestProject.Repositories;

public sealed record UserRepository(ICaeriusDbConnectionFactory Caerius)
    : IUserRepository
{
    public async Task<IEnumerable<UserDto>> GetUserOlderThanAsync(byte age)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public async Task UpdateCustomUserAgeByGuidAsync(Guid guid, byte age)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```
:::

We basically have an `Interface` that defines the methods that will be implemented in the `Repository` class.
 - One for the `Read` (`SELECT`) operations.
 - One for the `Write` (`INSERT INTO`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `MERGE`) operations.

In the below section, we will see how to implement the [`Read`](#read-operations) and [`Write`](#write-operations) operations.  

## Read Operations :

The `Read` operations are the `SELECT` operations.  
To implement the `GetUserOlderThanAsync` method, we need to follow these steps :
 - Start on the `TSQL` side, by creating a `Stored Procedure`.  
 - Turn to the `C#` side, by creating the C# DTO Mapping.  
 - Continue with C# by implementing the `GetUserOlderThanAsync` with the usage of the `StoredProcedureParametersBuilder` class.  

## TSQL : Stored Procedure

To make it possible, you need to use the `SELECT` statement and make it match the column names of your DTO properties.   
For this you can use aliases (`AS`) to match them.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.sp_GetUser_By_Age
    @Age TINYINT = 18
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON
    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED
    
    BEGIN TRY
        BEGIN TRANSACTION
        
            SELECT
                myColumnGuid AS Guid,
                myColumnId AS Id,
                myColumnUsername AS Username,
                myColumnAge Age,
                myColumnCreatedAt CreatedAt,
                myColumnPoints Points
            FROM
                dbo.Users
            WHERE
                Age >= @Age
        
        IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
            COMMIT TRANSACTION
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION
    END CATCH
END
```

### Explanations

To explain this Stored Procedure example, we are using aliases to match the column names of our DTO.  
For people who are surprised by the absence of `AS` keyword, it's optional in TSQL.  
In any case, those usages are working the same way, chosen one that you prefer.

::: tip
We're using the default schema (`dbo`) on this example, it's highly recommended to use your own schema for your Stored Procedures usage.  
:::
## C# : DTO Mapping

We heavy recommend to use [`sealed`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/sealed) [`records`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record) for your DTOs.  
The reasons are :
- Specified by the `sealed` keyword, records cannot be inherited.
- Records are immutable.
- Records are lightweight.
- Records override by nature the `Equals` and `GetHashCode` methods.
- Records use by default the [`Primary Constructor`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/primary-constructors).
- Records are easy to read and to use.

You need to use the `ISpMapper<T>` interface to map the result of your Stored Procedure to your DTO.

```csharp
namespace TestProject.Models.Dtos;

public sealed record UserDto(
    Guid Guid,
    int Id,
    string Username,
    byte Age,
    DateTime CreatedAt,
    ushort Points)
    : ISpMapper<CustomUsersDto>
{
    public static UserDto MapFromReader(SqlDataReader reader)
    {
        return new UserDto(
            Guid = reader.GetGuid(0),
            Id = reader.GetInt32(1),
            Username = reader.GetString(2),
            Age = reader.GetByte(3),
            CreatedAt = reader.GetDateTime(4),
            Points = reader.GetUInt16(5)
        );
    }
}
```
### Explanations

To explain the `ISpMapper<T>` interface, it's a simple interface that contains a `MapFromReader` method.
This method will be used to map the result of the Stored Procedure to the DTO.

The [`SqlDataReader`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqldatareader?view=sqlclient-dotnet-standard-5.2) object is used to read the result of the Stored Procedure,
using the stream of data returned by the SQL Server from the [`TDS (Tabular Data Stream) protocol`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tds/b46a581a-39de-4745-b076-ec4dbb7d13ec).  

Because it's working like a buffer, you need to specify the index of the column you want to read, and the type of the column you want to read.  

This help to map correctly the result of the Stored Procedure to the DTO.

## C# : Stored Procedure Builder

It's the following step after making the `Repository` class, [C# : Repository](#c-repository).

On the example below, we will implement the `GetUserOlderThanAsync` method.

```csharp
namespace TestProject.Repositories;

public sealed record UserRepository(ICaeriusDbConnectionFactory Caerius)
    : IUserRepository
{
    public async Task<IEnumerable<UserDto>> GetUserOlderThanAsync(byte userAge)
    {
        var spParams = new StoredProcedureParametersBuilder("dbo.sp_GetUser_By_Age", 450)
            .AddParameter("Age", userAge, SqlDbType.TinyInt);

        var users = await Caerius.QueryAsync<UserDto>(spParams);

        return users;
    }
}
```

### Explanations

To explain the `StoredProcedureParametersBuilder` class, it's a class that will help you to build the parameters of the Stored Procedure.  

You need to specify the name of the Stored Procedure and the List Capacity, because behind the scene, we are using a `List<T>` to store the result of the Stored Procedure.  
You need to be the most accurate as possible to the number of rows that will be returned by the Stored Procedure.  
Check our [Benchmarks](https://caerius.net/benchmarks) to see the impact of the List Capacity.

After that, you need to add the parameters of the Stored Procedure, with the name of the parameter, the value of the parameter, and the type of the parameter.  



## Write Operations :

The `Write` operations are the `INSERT INTO`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `MERGE` operations.  

To implement the `UpdateUserAgeByGuidAsync` method, we need to follow these steps :
 - Start on the `TSQL` side, by creating a `Stored Procedure`.  
 - Back to the `C#` side, by implementing the `UpdateUserAgeByGuidAsync` with the usage of the `StoredProcedureParametersBuilder` class.


## TSQL : Stored Procedure

You need to create a Stored Procedure for the `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` or `MERGE` operations, here we will see the `UPDATE` operation.  

For this specific example, we will update the `Age` of a user by his `Guid`, with the possibility to use multiple parameters.  

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.sp_UpdateUserAge_By_Guid
    @Guid UNIQUEIDENTIFIER,
    @Age TINYINT
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON
    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED
    
    BEGIN TRY
        BEGIN TRANSACTION
        
            UPDATE dbo.Users
            SET Age = @Age
            WHERE Guid = @Guid
        
        IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
            COMMIT TRANSACTION
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION
    END CATCH
END
```

## C# : Stored Procedure Builder

It's the following step after making the `Repository` class, [4. C# : Repository](#_4-c-repository).

On the example below, we will implement the `UpdateUserAgeByGuidAsync` method, based on the `Stored Procedure` we have created.  
With this method we are required to define the `Guid` and the `Age` parameters.
::: code-group
```csharp [With Affected Rows]
namespace TestProject.Repositories;

public sealed record UserRepository(ICaeriusDbConnectionFactory Caerius)
    : IUserRepository
{

    public async Task<int> UpdateUserAgeByGuidAsync(Guid userGuid, byte userAge)
    {
        var spParams = new StoredProcedureParametersBuilder("dbo.sp_UpdateCustomUserAge_By_Guid")
            .AddParameter("Guid", userGuid, SqlDbType.UniqueIdentifier)
            .AddParameter("Age", userAge, SqlDbType.TinyInt);

        var rows = await Caerius.ExecuteAsync(spParams);
        
        return rows;
    }
}
```
```csharp [Without Affected Rows]
namespace TestProject.Repositories;

public sealed record UserRepository(ICaeriusDbConnectionFactory Caerius)
    : IUserRepository
{

    public async Task UpdateUserAgeByGuidAsync(Guid userGuid, byte userAge)
    {
        var spParams = new StoredProcedureParametersBuilder("dbo.sp_UpdateCustomUserAge_By_Guid")
            .AddParameter("Guid", userGuid, SqlDbType.UniqueIdentifier)
            .AddParameter("Age", userAge, SqlDbType.TinyInt);

        return await Caerius.ExecuteScalarAsync(spParams);
    }
}
```

### Explanations

To explain the `ExecuteAsync` and `ExecuteScalarAsync` methods, they are used to execute the Stored Procedure, as `Fire and Forget`.
 - `ExecuteAsync` is used for `INSERT INTO`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `MERGE` operations,  
and _**will not**_ return the number of rows affected by the operation.

 - `ExecuteScalarAsync` is used for `INSERT INTO`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `MERGE` operations,  
and _**will**_ return the number of rows affected by the operation.  

**Note** : You don't have to specify the `List Capacity` for the `ExecuteAsync` and `ExecuteScalarAsync` methods, because they are not returning a `List<T>`.
